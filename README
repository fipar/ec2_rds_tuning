*****
EBS-Optimized Instances: For a low, additional, hourly fee, customers can launch selected Amazon EC2 instances types as “EBS-Optimized” instances. EBS-Optimized instances enable Amazon EC2 instances to fully utilize the IOPS provisioned on an EBS volume. EBS-optimized instances deliver dedicated throughput between Amazon EC2 and Amazon EBS, with options between 500 Mbps and 1000 Mbps depending on the instance type used. When attached to EBS-Optimized instances, Provisioned IOPS volumes are designed to deliver within 10% of their provisioned performance 99.9% of the time. See Amazon EC2 Instance Types to find out more about instance types that can be launched as EBS-optimized instances.
